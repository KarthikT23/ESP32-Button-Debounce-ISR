# ESP32-Button-Debounce-ISR
This project demonstrates how to handle button inputs with debouncing using Interrupt Service Routines (ISR) on the ESP32 Microcontroller, using Espressif-IDE. 

# Requirements
1) ESP32 Development Board (e.g., ESP32 DevKitC)

2) Two Push Buttons (normally open type)

3) Two Pull-Up Resistors (Optional, 10kÎ© each if internal pull-up resistors are not used)

4) Breadboard 

5) Jumper Wires


# Circuit connections
1) Push Button 1:
One terminal of Button 1 to GPIO18 on the ESP32 (labeled as BUTTON1_GPIO in the code).
Other terminal of Button 1 to GND (Ground).

2) Push Button 2:
One terminal of Button 2 to GPIO19 on the ESP32 (labeled as BUTTON2_GPIO in the code).
Other terminal of Button 2 to GND.

3) Internal Pull-Up Resistors:

The code enables internal pull-up resistors for the GPIO pins (GPIO_PULLUP_ENABLE). Therefore, external pull-up resistors are not strictly necessary unless you prefer to use them.
