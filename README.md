# ESP32-Button-Debounce-ISR
This project demonstrates how to handle button inputs with debouncing using Interrupt Service Routines (ISR) on the ESP32 Microcontroller, using Espressif-IDE. 

# Requirements
1) ESP32 Development Board (e.g., ESP32 DevKitC)

2) Two Push Buttons (normally open type)

3) Two Pull-Up Resistors (Optional, 10kÎ© each if internal pull-up resistors are not used)

4) Breadboard 

5) Jumper Wires
